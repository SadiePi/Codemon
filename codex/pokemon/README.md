The most complete Pokedex ever made. Currently a work in progress, this Codex
will contain all species, all moves, all items, all everything from every generation,
all translated from Bulbapedia to functional code using this library.

This can be used as a base for custom Codexes, as in the Uranium demo, or you
can use it as just a reference for how to use the library.
