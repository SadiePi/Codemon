# Codemon Codex

This directory contains various Codexes for Codemon.

Data entry is an early work in progress, but I think the data structure is finally stable enough to be useful. Contributions are very welcome! Fleshing out the full Pok√©dex is my main priority, but I'm also happy to accept PRs for other games (though I'd prefer for `/src` to remain a solo project).

## Basic Usage

Import the Codex and inspect the data (see [/README.md](../../README.md) for actual usage):

```ts
import P from "https://deno.land/x/codemon/codex/pokemon/index.ts"; // note: not yet published

const bulbasaur = P.Species.Bulbasaur;
bulbasaur.name; // "Bulbasaur"
bulbasaur.baseStats; // { hp: 45, attack: 49, defense: 49, specialAttack: 65, specialDefense: 65, speed: 45 }

const types = bulbasaur.types; // [ P.Types.Grass, P.Types.Poison ]
types[0].name; // "Grass"
types[0].resistances; // [ P.Types.Fire, P.Types.Grass, P.Types.Poison, P.Types.Flying, P.Types.Bug, P.Types.Dragon, P.Types.Steel ]

const abilities = bulbasaur.abilities; // [ P.Abilities.Overgrow, P.Abilities.Chlorophyll ]
abilities[0].apply.toString(); // TODO: add this
```

## Data Structure

If the Codex is implemented properly, it will have full intellisense support in your IDE, providing you with each option in each category. For example, if you type `P.Species.` in VSCode, you'll see a list of all the Pok√©mon in the Pok√©dex.

```ts
// codemon/src/codex.ts
interface Codex {
  Abilities: Record<string, Ability>;
  Experience: Record<string, ExperienceGroup>;
  Genders: Record<string, Gender>; // üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
  Items: Record<string, Item>;
  Moves: Record<string, Move>;
  Natures: Record<string, Nature>;
  Species: Record<string, Species>;
  Statuses: Record<string, StatusEffect>;
  Trainers: Record<string, Trainer>;
  Types: Record<string, Type>;
  Weathers: Record<string, Weather>;
}
```
