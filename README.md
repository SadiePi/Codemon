# Typemon
My attempt at a fully modular reimplementation of Pokémon in Typescript  

The root contains all the core files.  
/standards contains standard types, species, items, etc.  
/demo contains demos for defining new content   


Yes, I know about Pokémon Essentials, but this is being designed to work in more than just RPG Maker.  
I'm also trying to reference PE as little as possible to not be influenced by design decisions its creators made
