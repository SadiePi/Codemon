# Codemon
My attempt at a fully modular reimplementation of Pokémon. It currently only uses Typescript, but eventually I'd like to support multiple languages by reimplementing the details in those languages.

The root contains all the core files.  
/standards contains standard types, species, items, etc.  
/demo contains demos for defining new content   

Yes, I know about Pokémon Essentials, but this is being designed to work in more than just RPG Maker.  
I'm also trying to reference PE as little as possible to not be influenced by design decisions its creators made
