# Codemon

My attempt at a fully modular reimplementation of Pokémon. This implementation is being done in Typescript, but I'd eventually like to make implementations of this library in many common languages.

My current plan is to eventually have a full, CLI-only game in `/demo`. Further graphics will have to be done by developers using this library.

I do know about Pokémon Essentials, though I've never personally used it, but this is being designed to work in more than just RPG Maker. I'm also trying to reference PE as little as possible to not be influenced by design decisions its creators made. I want this to be something actually new (except for Pokémon itself obviously)

# Important Note!!!

All raw data (like base stats, not implementation details) is manually copied directly from Bulbapedia. I did not discover any of it myself, and I'm not sure if it's 100% accurate.
