# Codemon

A WIP fully modular reimplementation of Pok√©mon. This implementation is being done in Typescript with Deno, but I'd eventually like to make implementations of this library in many common languages.

Currently, the following features are more or less complete and fully modular:

- Species
- Codex (Pok√©dex)
- Individual Codemon (Pok√©mon)
- Moves
- Types
- Stats
- Natures
- Leveling
- Genders (üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è)
- Abstract Battle System

With these well on their way:

- Traditional battle using the above
- Abilities
- Items
- Weather
- Status Effects
- AI Controllers
- Abstract Player Controller

And these planned for the future:

- Evolution
- Breeding
- Trainers
- Locales
- Abstract World Map (for use in MVC)

The Codex currently has placeholder entries for all traditional Species, Moves, Types, Natures, Abilities, Items, Weathers, and Status Effects. Most are just placeholders, but all types, all gen 1 moves, and a few Pok√©mon been translated from their entries on [Bulbapedia](bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net).

My current long-term plan is to have a full, CLI-only game in `/demo/game`. Further graphics will have to be done by developers using this library.

## Contributing

I'd prefer for the core functionality to remain a personal project, but I would appreciate contributions to flesh out the Bulbapedia translations and find things that this doesn't support yet. If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue or pull request.
